# CryptoMarket-MVVM
CryptoMarket is an app which includes a huge variety of crypto currencies and shows them to users.I used MVVM design pattern in this project.I created a asycn webservice file and write a function that downloads data from json file.I created two struct in viewmodel file.One of these structs is about currency list and arrays.The other one is directly about crypto currency.I used tableview to list all these datas.I successfully listed currencies and showed to user.I have tried to make beatufil tableview and used 3 tones of gray.
